    <h3>Roles of the IRT and Magnet Coordinator</h3>
    My role as an Instructional Resource Teacher (IRT) is to support all teachers as they support all students. I am here to assist with curriculum and instruction and classroom intervention, so that teachers and students can achieve their very best.<br>
    I am also the Magnet Coordinator. As both IRT and Magnet Coordinator, I provide professional and staff development, and instructional support to classroom teachers and support staff in an effort to
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure the successful implementation of our magnet themes</li>
        <li>Ensure sound instructional core practices and strategies in the teaching of Common Core state standards that are rigorous, relevant and provided in a nurturing environment</li>
    </ul>
    We all have something to share with and gain from each other;<br>
    I'm happy to be here...to help, to share, to learn! The best is yet to come...
